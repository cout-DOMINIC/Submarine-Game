In the fifth semester of my bachelor studies at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences I developed this game in a four-member team. We used Unity with C#. In addition to the implementation of various features, I supported the team as Scrum Master. The topic was "Little Rocket Man" and the game focusses to explore an open-world and to solve tricky puzzles.

During the development we also made a physical prototype to improve the game experience. In the picture you can see for example the home planet.

Furthermore we made some playtesting sessions with friends or familiy member to fix some bugs and gain feedback.
