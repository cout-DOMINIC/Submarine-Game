# Submarine
Besides Tic Tac Toe, Submarine was one of my very first games I have ever developed.

As part of my studies in the fourth semester of my bachelor studies at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences a classmate and I developed Submarine with the framework Qt in C++. It was also my very first time to code in C++ and I really loved it.
<br/><br/>
We had 3 weeks for the developing.
<br/><br/>
The gameplay is very simple - like in the game Space Invaders, enemies are floating down from the top trying to hit the player. The player has to shoot the enemies to achieve points.. so yes, very simple. :) We used royalty-free vector images and also implemented royalty-free sound effects like the sonar pulse submarines make under water or a shooting sound when the player fires a torpedo.

For game testing, we invited friends and family to play and test the game.
