# Submarine
Besides Tic Tac Toe, Submarine was also one of my very first games I have ever developed.

As part of my studies in the fourth semester at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin, a classmate and I developed Submarine with the framework Qt in C/C++.
<br/><br/>
THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMPLE - LIKE IN THE GAME SPACE INVADERS, ENEMIES ARE FLOATING DOWN FROM THE TOP TRYING TO HIT THE PLAYER. THE PLAYER HAS TO SHOOT THE ENEMIES TO ACHIEVE POINTS.. SO YES, VERY SIMPLE. WE USED ROYALTY-FREE VECTOR IMAGES (FOR THE ENEMIES, THE SUBMARINE AND TORPEDO) AND ALSO IMPLEMENTED ROYALTY-FREE SOUND EFFECTS LIKE THE SONAR PULSE SUBMARINES MAKE UNDER WATER OR A SHOOTING SOUND WHEN THE PLAYER FIRES A TORPEDO. <br/><br/>

I WAS TASKED WITH SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITIES - INCLUDING:
- PROGRAMMING ENEMIES AND PLAYER MOVEMENT
- SOUND EFFECTS IMPLEMENTATION
